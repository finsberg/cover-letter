# Simula Cover letter
Easily write letters in your academic or other professional life.

# Usage
Create your letter by following the template provided by the example letter `coverletter.md`. You can change your signature and institute logo by changing the `Signature.pdf` and `Simula.pdf` files, respectively. Once you have your markdown letter the way you like it, go ahead and run make:

```bash
make
```

An example of how the final version will look like can be found in [coverletter.pdf](coverletter.pdf)

# Dependencies
